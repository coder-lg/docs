  Learn how to best structure image specifications for use inside your
  organization.

Coder allows your organization to structure your image hierarchy however you'd
like. However, we've seen organizations do well by defining a set of
organization-wide base images from which all projects are created.

These base images extend common open-source base images. They also contain
security patches, org-wide utilities, and configuration settings/information
that individual project images will get by default when you create additional
images. For example:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04

# Install baseline packages
RUN apt-get update && DEBIAN_FRONTEND="noninteractive" apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    git \
    bash \
    curl \
    wget \
    unzip \
    htop \
    man \
    vim \
    sudo \
    python3 \
    python3-pip \
    ca-certificates \
    locales

# Add a user `coder` so that you're not developing as the `root` user
RUN adduser --gecos '' --disabled-password coder && \
  echo "coder ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers.d/nopasswd
USER coder
```

Your users can then create descendant images. These contain all of the original
tooling and configuration installed onto the base image and the new
customizations added by the users.
