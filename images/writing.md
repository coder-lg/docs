Custom images allow you to define workspaces that include the dependencies,
scripts, and user preferences helpful for your project.

## Creating a custom image

Instead of starting from scratch, we recommend extending one of our
[sample images](https://github.com/cdr/enterprise-images):

```Dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM codercom/enterprise-base:ubuntu

RUN apt-get install -y ...
COPY file ./

...
```

Please note:

- If you're using a different base image, see our
  [image minimum requirements](https://github.com/cdr/enterprise-images/#image-minimums)
  to make sure that your image will work with all of Coder's features.

- You can build images inside a Coder workspace using the
  [Docker Sandbox](https://github.com/bpmct/cdr-images/tree/master/docker-sandbox).
  If, however, you're using [CVMs](../admin/environment-management/cvms.md),
  you'll need to have the [sysbox runtime](https://github.com/nestybox/sysbox)
  on your machine.

## Example: Installing an IntelliJ IDE

This snippet shows you how to install an IntelliJ IDE onto your image so that
you can use it in your Coder workspace:

```Dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM ...

# Install IDEs as root
USER root

RUN mkdir -p /opt/[IDE]
RUN curl -L \
"https://download.jetbrains.com/product?code=[CODE]&latest&distribution=linux" \
| tar -C /opt/[IDE] --strip-components 1 -xzvf
RUN ln -s /opt/[IDE]/bin/clion.sh /usr/bin/[IDE]
```

Make sure that you replace `[IDE]` with the name of the IDE in lowercase and
provide its
[corresponding `[CODE]`](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/marketplace/product-codes.html).

More specifically, here's how to install the CLion IDE onto your image:

```Dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM ...

USER root

# Install CLion
RUN mkdir -p /opt/clion
RUN curl -L \
"https://download.jetbrains.com/product?code=CL&latest&distribution=linux" \
| tar -C /opt/clion --strip-components 1 -xzvf
RUN ln -s /opt/clion/bin/clion.sh /usr/bin/clion
```

## Sample images

To get an idea of what you can include in your images, see:

  to in [Coffee and Coder](https://community.coder.com/coffee-and-coder) and the
  [Coder blog](https://coder.com/blog))
