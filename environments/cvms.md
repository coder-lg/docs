description: Learn how to securely run Docker inside your Environment.

Standard Coder Environments run as normal Docker containers. This carries
limitations as to what applications you can run inside your Environment.
Most notably, it's not possible to run Docker securely within normal Docker
containers.

Coder offers an alternative Environment deployment option that allows you to
run Docker, Docker Compose, systemd, and other system-level applications
securely within your development containers. We call this environment variant
a _Container-based Virtual Machine (CVM)_.

## Container-based Virtual Machine (CVM)

By choosing this option,
your Environment behaves like a VM or raw host, yet retains the image, security,
and performance properties of typical containers.

To create an Environment capable of securely running system-level applications
like Docker, check the `Run as Container-based Virtual Machine` box when you
create a new Environment.

## Disk

Standard environments only persist the `/home` directory in your Environment
disk. CVM Environments have additional levels of persistence:

1. `/var/lib/docker` is stored in your Environment disk and is persisted
   between rebuilds.
   This prevents shutdowns and rebuilds from purging the Docker cache.

1. The Environment Image is itself stored in your Environment disk.
   Note that this data is never directly accessible to you but will still consume
   data on your disk and count towards the size limit.

When setting default disk sizes for [Images](../images/index.md), plan for these
additional storage requirements. We recommend treating the environment as a full
machine, so disk sizes in the range of 50-100 GB are reasonable.
This is especially true if users of the image are storing large Docker caches.
