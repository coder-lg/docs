Environments are designed to sustain scheduled shutdowns and rebuilds. An
environment lifecycle resilient to stops and starts means you can save dollars
on cloud compute and justify more powerful dev machines :).

## Rebuilds

Rebuilding an [Environment](index.md) allows you to update to the latest image,
edit resource requests, or restart your environment after a shutdown.

Only the `/home/<username>` directory persists between rebuilds. Rebuilds
do not affect configurations and source code within the `/home/<username>`
subtree, even if the underlying [Image](../images/index.md) or its dependencies
change.

   **Note:** `username` is defined in the image. See [Docker's image documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#user)

## Auto-Off

Organizations can set an auto-off inactivity threshold. After an Environment
hasn't been access for the specified threshold, it is shutdown. A stopped
environment requires a [rebuild](#Rebuilds) before you can accessed it again.
Read more about auto-off [here](../admin/environment-management/shutdown.md).

## Hooks

Coder exposes a few hooks during the build process. Once an Environment
is available and running on and underlying host, the following steps are taken

1. `Injecting secrets into environment`
   Coder injects authentication for the
   [Coder CLI](https://github.com/cdr/coder-cli), allowing
   the latter scripts to perform authenticated CLI commands.
   If your Coder instance is configured with a Git provider, your SSH key pair is
   injected during this step as well, allowing the latter scripts to perform
   authenticated `git` operations.

1. `Execution of /coder/configure`
   Execution of this script allows [Images](../images/index.md) to perform startup
   operations consistent across all of its Environments. If an image needs to
   perform modifications to the `/home`, it should do so in this script.

1. `Execution of ~/personalize`
   Execution of this script allows you to customize your personal development Environment
   on each rebuild. Read more on personalization [here](./personalization.md).
