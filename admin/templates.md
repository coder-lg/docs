  Learn how to create an embeddable "Open In Coder" button for your Workspaces
  As Code Template
---

The **Templates** tab features a form you can use for generating an embeddable
button. This button makes it easy for developers to use your
[workspace template](../environments/workspaces-as-code/index.md).

To create your button:

1. Go to **Manage** > **Admin** > **Templates**.
1. Fill out the fields.

Once you've filled out the form, Coder generates a custom Markdown snippet,
which you can then add to your repository's `README.md`.
