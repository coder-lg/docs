This guide will show you how to manage your Git configuration in Coder.

## Personal git Configurations

Coder will create a global git configuration file located at `~/.gitconfig` in all
newly created environments and set the user name and email address using the
information associated with the user's Coder account.

This step occurs before [coder/configure](https://coder.com/docs/images/configure)
and [personalization](https://coder.com/docs/environments/personalization),
which can be used to override the default `.gitconfig` created by Coder.
If there's already a `.gitconfig` file, Coder will not recreate a default
version when you rebuild an environment.

We recommend that each Coder user set and modify their personal .gitconfig file
using the [~/personalize script](../environments/personalization.md).

**Preferences defined using individual `.gitconfig` files take precedence over
system-level settings.**

## System and Global git Configurations

If you have a set of git configuration instructions that apply to your
organization as a whole, you can define and use a system-level git
configuration. We suggest adding the system-level `.gitconfig` directly to the
image's Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
# Add system-level gitconfig
COPY ["gitconfig", "/etc/gitconfig"]
```

As you can see from the example, system-level git configurations live
under `/etc/gitconfig`. If present, `git` applies the settings to each repository.
However, any Coder user can override system-level settings
using global or worktree git configurations.

For more information on git configuration, refer to the [official documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config)
