The articles in this section will walk you through setting up a cluster to which
Coder deploys and then deploying Coder.

Coder is free to try, though you'll need a license to do so. You can [generate a
   license](https://coder.com/trial) that allows you to try Coder free of charge
   for 60 days. You'll provide this license *after* you've completed the
   deployment steps.

> If you're interested in a lightweight preview of Coder, check out our [local
   preview](kubernetes/local-preview) option.

## Deploying Coder

1. Before you start, we recommend familiarizing yourself with Coder's
   [requirements](#requirements).

1. To begin the deployment process, see our docs on creating a [Kubernetes
   cluster](kubernetes/index.md) and [installing Coder](installation.md).
